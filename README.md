This is a quick and dirty proof of concept port of the [RPLIDARC1 python package](https://github.com/dsaadatmandi/rplidarc1)

There's a bunch of leftover printouts and unimplemented functions, but it gets data from the device, and should be enough to get you where you want to go with a direcct coupling between the C1 and an ESP32.

Have fun!
